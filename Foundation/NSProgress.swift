 NSProgress is used to report the amount of work done, and provides a way to allow the user to cancel that work.
 
 Since work is often split up into several parts, progress objects can form a tree where children represent part of the overall total work. Each parent may have as many children as required, but each child only has one parent. The top level progress object in this tree is typically the one that you would display to a user. The leaf objects are updated as work completes, and the updates propagate up the tree.
 
 The work that an NSProgress does is tracked via a "unit count." There are two unit count values: total and completed. In its leaf form, an NSProgress is created with a total unit count and its completed unit count is updated with -setCompletedUnitCount: until it matches the total unit count. The progress is then considered finished.
 
 When progress objects form nodes in trees, they are still created with a total unit count. Portions of the total are then handed out to children as a "pending unit count." The total amount handed out to children should add up to the parent's totalUnitCount. When those children become finished, the pending unit count assigned to that child is added to the parent's completedUnitCount. Therefore, when all children are finished, the parent's completedUnitCount is equal to its totalUnitCount and it becomes finished itself.
 
 Children NSProgress objects can be added implicitly or by invoking the -addChild:withPendingUnitCount: method on the parent. Implicitly added children are attached to a parent progress between a call to -becomeCurrentWithPendingUnitCount: and a call to -resignCurrent. The implicit child is created with the +progressWithTotalUnitCount: method or by passing the result of +currentProgress to the -initWithParent:userInfo: method. Both kinds of children can be attached to the same parent progress object. If you have an idea in advance that some portions of the work will take more or less time than the others, you can use different values of pending unit count for each child.
 
 If you are designing an interface of an object that reports progress, then the recommended approach is to vend an NSProgress property and adopt the NSProgressReporting protocol. The progress should be created with the -discreteProgressWithTotalUnitCount: method. You can then either update the progress object directly or set it to have children of its own. Users of your object can compose your progress into their tree by using the -addChild:withPendingUnitCount: method.
 
 If you want to provide progress reporting for a single method, then the recommended approach is to implicitly attach to a current NSProgress by creating an NSProgress object at the very beginning of your method using +progressWithTotalUnitCount:. This progress object will consume the pending unit count, and then you can set up the progress object with children of its own.

 The localizedDescription and localizedAdditionalDescription properties are meant to be observed as well as set. So are the cancellable and pausable properties. totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount on the other hand are often not the best properties to observe when presenting progress to the user. For example, you should observe fractionCompleted instead of observing totalUnitCount and completedUnitCount and doing your own calculation. NSProgress' default implementation of fractionCompleted does fairly sophisticated things like taking child NSProgresses into account.

The purpose of this per-thread value is to allow code that does work to usefully report progress even when it is widely separated from the code that actually presents progress to the user, without requiring layers of intervening code to pass the instance of NSProgress through. Using the result of invoking this directly will often not be the right thing to do, because the invoking code will often not even know what units of work the current progress object deals in. Invoking +progressWithTotalUnitCount: to create a child NSProgress object and then using that to report progress makes more sense in that situation.

    You can invoke this method on one thread and then message the returned NSProgress on another thread. For example, you can let the result of invoking this method get captured by a block passed to dispatch_async().

       With this mechanism, code that doesn't know anything about its callers can report progress accurately by using +progressWithTotalUnitCount: and -setCompletedUnitCount:. The calling code will account for the fact that the work done is only a portion of the work to be done as part of a larger operation. The unit of work in a call to -becomeCurrentWithPendingUnitCount: has to be the same unit of work as that used for the value of the totalUnitCount property, but the unit of work used by the child can be a completely different one, and often will be.

The values may be reported to the user in the localizedDescription and localizedAdditionalDescription.
     
       If the receiver NSProgress object is a "leaf progress" (no children), then the fractionCompleted is generally completedUnitCount / totalUnitCount.
