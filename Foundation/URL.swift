/**
 URLs to file system resources support the properties defined below. Note that not all property values will exist for all file system URLs. For example, if a file is located on a volume that does not support creation dates, it is valid to request the creation date property, but the returned value will be nil, and no error will be generated.
 
 Only the fields requested by the keys you pass into the `URL` function to receive this value will be populated. The others will return `nil` regardless of the underlying property on the file system.
 
 As a convenience, volume resource values can be requested from any file system URL. The value returned will reflect the property value for the volume on which the resource is located.

         ‚Ä¢ a new URL object could not be created with the modified URL string.
         
         Note 1: If NS/CFURL parsed URLs correctly, this would not occur because URL strings always have a path component. For example, the URL <mailto:user@example.com> should be parsed as Scheme=‚Äúmailto‚Äù, and Path= ‚Äúuser@example.com". Instead, CFURL returns false for CFURLCanBeDecomposed(), says Scheme=‚Äúmailto‚Äù, Path=nil, and ResourceSpecifier=‚Äúuser@example.com‚Äù. rdar://problem/15060399
         
         Note 2: CFURLCreateWithBytes() and CFURLCreateAbsoluteURLWithBytes() allow URLs to be created with an array of bytes and a CFStringEncoding. All other CFURL functions and URL methods which create URLs use kCFStringEncodingUTF8/NSUTF8StringEncoding. So, the encoding passed to CFURLCreateWithBytes/CFURLCreateAbsoluteURLWithBytes might prevent the percent-encoding of the new path component or path extension.
